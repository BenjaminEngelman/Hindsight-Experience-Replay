Lmod has detected the following error: A different version of the 'intel'
module is already loaded (see output of 'ml').
You should load another '"..framesn.."' module for that is compatible with
the currently loaded version of '"..sname.."'."
Use 'ml spider Keras' to get an overview of the available versions.
